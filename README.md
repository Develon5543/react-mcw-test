This is a project that combines React and Material Components for the Web. It was meant to be a proof of concept to see if merging the two would cause any issues. After this, I was going to create a project using both of these libraries. This project also uses nw.js in order to demonstrate that a webapp can use these technologies.

Since this project is supposed to be a proof of concept, it is in a finished state despite not being very usable. (For instance, not all of the buttons have ripples yet.)
